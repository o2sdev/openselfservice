# First release of Open Self Service

We're excited to announce the first release of **Open Self Service (O2S)** – an open-source framework for building composable, API-agnostic customer service & support frontends.

<!--truncate-->

As promised, the project went live on **March 10th, 2025**, together with our public roadmap. In the coming weeks, we’ll focus on building a community of developers and contributors around the project.

We also have a lot of improvements and new features planned — all listed in our [Roadmap](2025-03-10-roadmap.md). You’re invited to help shape it with us.

## What is Open Self Service?

**Open Self Service (O2S)** is a developer toolkit for building enterprise-grade, API-first, composable frontend apps for customer support.

Built on Hycom.digital’s real-world experience with MACH-based e-commerce and customer service solutions, technically inspired by composable commerce frontends.

Open Self Service brings the same architectural benefits to customer service portals — while remaining flexible enough for any API-driven frontend.

## What’s included?

### Framework capabilities

- **Frontend app starter**
  Built with **Next.js** and fully manageable via headless CMS (currently integrated with Strapi). You get routing, localization, theming, and extensible UI components (based on Tailwind + shadcn/ui).

- **API Harmonization Server**
  A backend-for-frontend layer based on **NestJS** that integrates multiple APIs, orchestrates data, and delivers it in a unified format to the frontend app.

- **SDK**
  TypeScript SDK that provides a typed interface to access harmonized APIs from your web, mobile, or chatbot applications.

- **Pre-built integrations**
  Available for CMS (Strapi), Auth (NextAuth), and search (planned), with more to come (CRM, ERP, commerce, and others).

- **Fully customizable**
  Everything in O2S is modular: the frontend, API harmonization, integrations, and UI components can be extended, replaced, or removed.

### Built-in frontend features

O2S ships with working views and pages that reflect key capabilities of modern customer service portals (inspired by [Gartner’s 11 Fundamental Capabilities](https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/topics/self-service-customer-service)).

You can use them out of the box or as a starting point for further customization.

- **User Account & Settings** – manage user profiles, security, and preferences
- **Dashboard** – unified overview of services, products, tickets, and invoices
- **Case Management** – submit and track tickets or service requests
- **Payments & Invoices** – access transaction history and download invoices
- **Knowledge Base** – full-text search and category-based navigation
- **Services & Products** – see product subscriptions, warranties, and details
- **Notifications** – view in-app messages and system alerts
