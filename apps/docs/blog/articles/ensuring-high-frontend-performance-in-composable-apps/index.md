# Ensuring high Frontend performance in composable apps

In today's web development landscape, composable architectures are gaining popularity for their flexibility and scalability. However, this approach introduces unique performance challenges. This article explores strategies and best practices for ensuring high frontend performance in composable applications, using Open Self Service as a practical example.

## Understanding Composable Architecture

### What is a Composable Architecture?
- Definition and key characteristics
- Benefits of composable frontends
- Challenges for performance optimization

### The Separation of Concerns
- Frontend-backend decoupling
- API harmonization layer
- Data normalization patterns

### Component-Based Design
- Blocks approach
- Performance implications of using block composition

## Key Performance Strategies

### Server-Side Rendering and Streaming
- Leveraging Next.js server components
- Component-level streaming with Suspense
- Parallel data loading for composable blocks
- Optimizing the streaming boundary placement

### Granular Hydration Control ???
- Progressive and selective hydration techniques
- Balancing SSR and client-side rendering
- Hydration prioritization for interactive blocks

### Dynamic Component Loading
- Code splitting at the block level ???
- Dynamic imports for composable blocks
- Intelligent prefetching strategies ???
- Optimizing the loading sequence of interdependent blocks

## Advanced Performance Techniques

### Efficient Data Fetching
- API request batching and aggregation
- Data harmonization for frontend efficiency
- Multi-level caching strategies for composable blocks
- Optimizing data flow between harmonization layer and blocks

### Composable Block Rendering Optimization
- Block-level rendering isolation
- Preventing render cascades across block boundaries
- Strategic use of Suspense boundaries for parallel loading
- Optimizing block dependencies and composition patterns

### Bundle Size Optimization ???
- Tree-shaking for composable applications
- Shared dependencies management across blocks
- Block-specific code splitting strategies
- Monitoring and analyzing per-block bundle sizes

## Conclusion

Creating high-performance composable frontends requires a thoughtful approach to architecture, component design, and data management. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article, developers can build flexible, maintainable applications without sacrificing user experience or performance.

The Open Self Service framework demonstrates how these principles can be applied in practice, providing a solid foundation for building performant composable applications that scale with your needs.
