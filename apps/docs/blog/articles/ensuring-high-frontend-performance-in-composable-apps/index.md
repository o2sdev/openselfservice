# Ensuring high Frontend performance in composable apps

In today's web development landscape, composable architectures are gaining popularity for their flexibility and scalability. However, this approach introduces unique performance challenges. This article explores strategies and best practices for ensuring high frontend performance in composable applications, using Open Self Service as a practical example.

## Understanding Composable Architecture

### What is a Composable Architecture?

Composable architecture is an approach to building applications by assembling modular, independent components that work together to create a complete solution. In the context of Open Self Service, it's a framework that enables the integration of multiple API-based services to provide a seamless user experience.

At its core, composable architecture is characterized by:

- **Modularity**: Applications are built from discrete, interchangeable components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **API-first approach**: Components communicate through well-defined APIs, allowing for flexibility in implementation details.
- **Decoupled systems**: Frontend and backend systems are separated, enabling each to evolve independently without affecting the other.

Composable frontends provide significant advantages: flexibility to replace components without disruption, scalability of specific parts based on demand, adaptability to changing requirements, and freedom from vendor lock-in through multi-backend integration.

### The Separation of Concerns

In building Open Self Service, we chose to implement a clear separation of concerns between different layers of the application. While there are multiple ways to achieve composable architecture, our approach focuses on:

- **Frontend-backend decoupling**: We completely separated the presentation layer from the data and business logic layers. This allows each to evolve independently and enables the frontend to work seamlessly with multiple backend services.

- **API composition layer**: Our implementation introduces an intermediate layer that acts as a bridge between the frontend and various backend APIs. This layer aggregates data from multiple sources and orchestrates data flows between systems. It efficiently combines static content with dynamic data while handling complex logic server-side, reducing browser processing overhead.

This approach ensures backend service changes don't require frontend code modifications, reducing maintenance overhead and increasing flexibility.

### Component-Based Design

Our implementation uses a "blocks" system of independent, reusable components that encapsulate specific functionality and connect to the API composition layer. This approach enables parallel data fetching, HTML streaming, and component-specific optimizations through Next.js server components. The result is improved maintainability and performance with granular optimizations for responsive user experiences.

## Key Performance Strategies

### Server-Side Rendering and Streaming
- Leveraging Next.js server components
- Component-level streaming with Suspense
- Parallel data loading for composable blocks
- Optimizing the streaming boundary placement

### Granular Hydration Control ???
- Progressive and selective hydration techniques
- Balancing SSR and client-side rendering
- Hydration prioritization for interactive blocks

### Dynamic Component Loading
- Code splitting at the block level ???
- Dynamic imports for composable blocks
- Intelligent prefetching strategies ???
- Optimizing the loading sequence of interdependent blocks

## Advanced Performance Techniques

### Efficient Data Fetching
- API request batching and aggregation
- Data harmonization for frontend efficiency
- Multi-level caching strategies for composable blocks
- Optimizing data flow between harmonization layer and blocks

### Composable Block Rendering Optimization
- Block-level rendering isolation
- Preventing render cascades across block boundaries
- Strategic use of Suspense boundaries for parallel loading
- Optimizing block dependencies and composition patterns

### Bundle Size Optimization ???
- Tree-shaking for composable applications
- Shared dependencies management across blocks
- Block-specific code splitting strategies
- Monitoring and analyzing per-block bundle sizes

## Conclusion

Creating high-performance composable frontends requires a thoughtful approach to architecture, component design, and data management. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article, developers can build flexible, maintainable applications without sacrificing user experience or performance.

The Open Self Service framework demonstrates how these principles can be applied in practice, providing a solid foundation for building performant composable applications that scale with your needs.
