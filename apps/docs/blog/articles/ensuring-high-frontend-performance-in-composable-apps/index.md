# Ensuring high Frontend performance in composable apps

In today's web development landscape, composable architectures are gaining popularity for their flexibility and scalability. However, this approach introduces unique performance challenges. This article explores strategies and best practices for ensuring high frontend performance in composable applications, using Open Self Service as a practical example.

## Understanding Composable Architecture

### What is a Composable Architecture?

Composable architecture is an approach to building applications by assembling modular, independent components that work together to create a complete solution. In the context of Open Self Service, it's a framework that enables the integration of multiple API-based services to provide a seamless user experience.

At its core, composable architecture is characterized by:

- **Modularity**: Applications are built from discrete, interchangeable components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **API-first approach**: Components communicate through well-defined APIs, allowing for flexibility in implementation details.
- **Decoupled systems**: Frontend and backend systems are separated, enabling each to evolve independently without affecting the other.

The benefits of composable frontends include:

- **Flexibility**: Easily replace or upgrade individual components without disrupting the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Scale specific components based on demand rather than scaling the entire application.
- **Future-proofing**: Adapt to changing requirements by swapping out components rather than rebuilding from scratch.
- **Vendor independence**: Avoid lock-in by being able to integrate with multiple backend services and switch providers as needed.

However, this approach introduces unique performance challenges:

- **Multiple API calls**: Composable applications often require data from various sources, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Data transformation overhead**: Converting data between different formats can impact performance.
- **Component coordination**: Ensuring efficient loading and rendering of interdependent components.

### The Separation of Concerns

A key principle of composable architecture is the clear separation of concerns between different layers of the application:

- **Frontend-backend decoupling**: The presentation layer (frontend) is completely separated from the data and business logic layers (backend). This allows each to evolve independently and enables the frontend to work with multiple backend services.

- **API harmonization layer**: Open Self Service introduces an intermediate layer that acts as a bridge between the frontend and various backend APIs. This layer:
  - Aggregates data from multiple sources
  - Orchestrates complex data flows
  - Combines static content (e.g., from a CMS) with dynamic user data
  - Makes the process more efficient by handling complex logic server-side rather than in the browser

- **Data normalization patterns**: To achieve true separation between UI and APIs, Open Self Service implements a normalization process that:
  - Defines a standardized data model that all integrated APIs must conform to
  - Transforms data from various sources into a predefined API-agnostic format
  - Provides base modules and classes that can be extended for new integrations
  - Allows the frontend to work with a consistent data structure regardless of the actual data source

This separation ensures that changes in backend services don't require corresponding changes in the frontend code, significantly reducing maintenance overhead and enabling greater flexibility.

### Component-Based Design

Composable applications are built using a component-based design approach, which in Open Self Service is implemented through a "blocks" system:

- **Blocks approach**: The frontend is composed of independent, reusable blocks that:
  - Encapsulate specific functionality (e.g., ticket lists, notifications, FAQs)
  - Can be arranged in different layouts and combinations
  - Are connected to corresponding harmonizing components on the server side
  - Can be developed, tested, and deployed independently

- **Performance implications of using block composition**:
  - Each block can load its data independently, enabling parallel data fetching
  - Server components can stream HTML to the browser as soon as data is available
  - Blocks can be optimized individually based on their specific requirements
  - The system leverages Next.js server components and streaming capabilities to make component loading asynchronous while keeping API requests server-side

This component-based design not only improves maintainability and reusability but also enables performance optimizations at a granular level, which is crucial for delivering a responsive user experience in complex composable applications.

## Key Performance Strategies

### Server-Side Rendering and Streaming
- Leveraging Next.js server components
- Component-level streaming with Suspense
- Parallel data loading for composable blocks
- Optimizing the streaming boundary placement

### Granular Hydration Control ???
- Progressive and selective hydration techniques
- Balancing SSR and client-side rendering
- Hydration prioritization for interactive blocks

### Dynamic Component Loading
- Code splitting at the block level ???
- Dynamic imports for composable blocks
- Intelligent prefetching strategies ???
- Optimizing the loading sequence of interdependent blocks

## Advanced Performance Techniques

### Efficient Data Fetching
- API request batching and aggregation
- Data harmonization for frontend efficiency
- Multi-level caching strategies for composable blocks
- Optimizing data flow between harmonization layer and blocks

### Composable Block Rendering Optimization
- Block-level rendering isolation
- Preventing render cascades across block boundaries
- Strategic use of Suspense boundaries for parallel loading
- Optimizing block dependencies and composition patterns

### Bundle Size Optimization ???
- Tree-shaking for composable applications
- Shared dependencies management across blocks
- Block-specific code splitting strategies
- Monitoring and analyzing per-block bundle sizes

## Conclusion

Creating high-performance composable frontends requires a thoughtful approach to architecture, component design, and data management. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article, developers can build flexible, maintainable applications without sacrificing user experience or performance.

The Open Self Service framework demonstrates how these principles can be applied in practice, providing a solid foundation for building performant composable applications that scale with your needs.
