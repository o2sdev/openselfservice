## New features

### Product Catalog blocks

This update introduces comprehensive product catalog support with three new blocks that enable you to build rich e-commerce and product browsing experiences within your self-service portal.

#### Product Details block

- **Product descriptions** with rich text support
- **Badges** for highlighting product attributes like "New", "Sale", or custom labels
- **Action buttons** for adding to cart, requesting quotes, or custom CTAs

```

#### Product List block

### Content blocks collection

We've migrated a comprehensive set of blocks from our DXP starter, designed for building rich content experiences. These blocks are perfect for marketing pages, landing pages, and content-rich sections of your portal:

- **Hero Section** - eye-catching hero areas with images, headlines, and call-to-action buttons
- **Feature Section** - showcase product features with icons, descriptions, and visual layouts
- **Feature Section Grid** - display multiple features in a responsive grid layout
- **CTA Section** - compelling call-to-action sections to drive user engagement
- **Pricing Section** - display pricing plans and comparison tables
- **Media Section** - embed videos, images, and rich media content
- **Bento Grid** - modern bento-box style layouts for visual storytelling
- **Document List** - display downloadable documents and resources

Each block follows the O2S architecture with API harmonization, frontend components, and SDK methods, making them fully customizable and CMS-configurable. You can see all these blocks in action in our [Storybook](https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/).

This migration is part of our broader strategy to merge O2S and DXP starters into one unified, more powerful and flexible tool that can handle a variety of use cases. Stay tuned for more updates!

### Summary blocks

Two new summary blocks provide quick insights directly on dashboard and list pages:

#### Ticket Summary block

![Ticket Summary Block](/img/blog/o2s-ticket-summary-block.png)

The `@o2s/blocks.ticket-summary` block displays a quick overview of ticket statistics:

- Total ticket counts by status
- Visual indicators for pending, open, and resolved tickets
- Configurable through CMS for custom layouts

#### Notification Summary block

![Notification Summary Block](/img/blog/o2s-notification-summary-block.png)

The `@o2s/blocks.notification-summary` block shows notification statistics at a glance:

- Unread notification counts
- Categorized notification summaries
- Quick access to notification management

Both summary blocks are designed to complement their respective list blocks, providing users with immediate insights without navigating to detail pages.

### DataView component with tile layouts

We've introduced a new `DataView` component that unifies grid and list rendering across data-heavy blocks. This enhancement brings tile (card) view support to:

- **Ticket List** - view tickets as cards with status indicators and quick actions
- **Order List** - browse orders in a visual card format
- **Invoice List** - see invoice summaries at a glance
- **Notification List** - scan notifications in a scannable tile layout

Users can now toggle between traditional table views and the new tile views based on their preference. The view mode can also be configured via CMS to set default display preferences per page.

## Other changes

### Storybook migration to Vite

We've migrated Storybook from Webpack to Vite, resulting in faster development experience:

- **Faster startup times** - Storybook now launches much quicker
- **Instant hot module replacement** - see changes immediately as you develop
- **Improved build performance** - faster production builds for the component library

Our public Storybook at [https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/](https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/) now runs on Vite, providing a snappier experience when browsing components and blocks.

### Developer experience improvements

This release includes improvements to the development workflow:

- **Next.js 16 upgrade** - upgraded to the latest Next.js version with improved performance and new features
- **Turbopack FileSystem Cache** - enabled [Turbopack caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopackFileSystemCache) for development, which saves and restores data between builds to greatly speed up subsequent dev sessions
- **Optimized dev tasks** - [reduced CPU and RAM usage](https://github.com/o2sdev/openselfservice/issues/420) during development by limiting Node.js processes and improving task orchestration
- **Improved build times** - faster incremental builds through better Turborepo configuration

### UI component enhancements

We've added and improved several UI components:

- **Phone Input** - new international phone number input with country code selection and validation

- **Checkboxes in lists** - enhanced list components with selection support for bulk actions
- **Improved Breadcrumbs** - better navigation breadcrumb rendering and accessibility
- **ActionList and MoreActionMenu** - enhanced action menus with better UX patterns

- Updated block documentation with implementation status for Contentful and Strapi
- Added Products module to the normalized data model documentation
