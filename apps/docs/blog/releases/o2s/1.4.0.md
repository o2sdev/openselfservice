## New features

### Product Catalog blocks

We're thrilled to introduce comprehensive product catalog support with two new blocks that enable you to build rich e-commerce and product browsing experiences within your self-service portal.

#### Product Details block

The new `@o2s/blocks.product-details` block provides a complete product presentation experience:

- **Product Gallery** with thumbnail navigation and lightbox support for detailed image viewing
- **Key specifications** displayed in an organized, scannable format
- **Product descriptions** with rich text support
- **Badges** for highlighting product attributes like "New", "Sale", or custom labels
- **Action buttons** for adding to cart, requesting quotes, or custom CTAs
- **Recommended products** section to showcase related items and drive cross-selling

```shell
npm install @o2s/blocks.product-details --workspace=@o2s/api-harmonization --workspace=@o2s/frontend
```

#### Product List block

The `@o2s/blocks.product-list` block enables powerful product browsing with flexible display options:

- **Grid and Table views** - switch between visual card layouts and detailed table formats
- **Product sorting** - sort products by name, price, date, or custom attributes
- **Filtering support** - integrate with the existing filter system for faceted navigation
- **Pagination** - handle large catalogs efficiently with built-in pagination
- **Product cards** with images, pricing, badges, and quick actions

```shell
npm install @o2s/blocks.product-list --workspace=@o2s/api-harmonization --workspace=@o2s/frontend
```

Both blocks integrate seamlessly with your existing CMS configuration and can be connected to various e-commerce backends through our integration layer.

### DXP blocks collection

We've added a comprehensive set of blocks designed for building rich Digital Experience Platform (DXP) frontends. These blocks are perfect for marketing pages, landing pages, and content-rich sections of your portal:

- **Hero Section** - eye-catching hero areas with images, headlines, and call-to-action buttons
- **Feature Section** - showcase product features with icons, descriptions, and visual layouts
- **Feature Section Grid** - display multiple features in a responsive grid layout
- **CTA Section** - compelling call-to-action sections to drive user engagement
- **Pricing Section** - display pricing plans and comparison tables
- **Media Section** - embed videos, images, and rich media content
- **Bento Grid** - modern bento-box style layouts for visual storytelling
- **Document List** - display downloadable documents and resources

Each block follows the O2S architecture with API harmonization, frontend components, and SDK methods, making them fully customizable and CMS-configurable.

### Summary blocks

Two new summary blocks provide quick insights directly on dashboard and list pages:

#### Ticket Summary block

The `@o2s/blocks.ticket-summary` block displays a quick overview of ticket statistics:

- Total ticket counts by status
- Visual indicators for pending, open, and resolved tickets
- Configurable through CMS for custom layouts

#### Notification Summary block

The `@o2s/blocks.notification-summary` block shows notification statistics at a glance:

- Unread notification counts
- Categorized notification summaries
- Quick access to notification management

Both summary blocks are designed to complement their respective list blocks, providing users with immediate insights without navigating to detail pages.

### DataView component with tile layouts

We've introduced a new `DataView` component that unifies grid and list rendering across data-heavy blocks. This enhancement brings tile (card) view support to:

- **Ticket List** - view tickets as cards with status indicators and quick actions
- **Order List** - browse orders in a visual card format
- **Invoice List** - see invoice summaries at a glance
- **Notification List** - scan notifications in a scannable tile layout

Users can now toggle between traditional table views and the new tile views based on their preference. The view mode can also be configured via CMS to set default display preferences per page.

## Other changes

### Storybook migration to Vite

We've migrated Storybook from Webpack to Vite, resulting in significantly faster development experience:

- **Faster startup times** - Storybook now launches much quicker
- **Instant hot module replacement** - see changes immediately as you develop
- **Improved build performance** - faster production builds for the component library

Our public Storybook at [https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/](https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/) now runs on Vite, providing a snappier experience when browsing components and blocks.

### Developer experience improvements

This release includes significant improvements to the development workflow:

- **Next.js 16 upgrade** - upgraded to the latest Next.js version with improved performance and new features
- **Optimized dev tasks** - reduced CPU and RAM usage during development by limiting Node.js processes and improving task orchestration
- **Improved build times** - faster incremental builds through better Turborepo configuration

### UI component enhancements

We've added and improved several UI components:

- **Phone Input** - new international phone number input with country code selection and validation
- **Inline Filters** with expandable sections - filters can now be displayed inline with collapsible sections for better space utilization
- **Checkboxes in lists** - enhanced list components with selection support for bulk actions
- **Improved Breadcrumbs** - better navigation breadcrumb rendering and accessibility
- **ActionList and MoreActionMenu** - enhanced action menus with better UX patterns
- **Collapsible component** - now supports `defaultOpen` prop for controlling initial state

### Improved error handling

We've enhanced error handling across multiple blocks with user-friendly feedback:

- Toast notifications for errors instead of silent failures
- Consistent error messaging patterns using CMS-configurable labels
- Better loading and error states in Article Search, Category, Invoice List, Notification Details/List, Order Details/List, Orders Summary, Service List, and Ticket List blocks

### Documentation reorganization

We've reorganized and improved our integration documentation:

- Restructured Strapi, Redis, Medusa, and Algolia documentation for better discoverability
- Updated block documentation with implementation status for Contentful and Strapi
- Added Products module to the normalized data model documentation
- Enhanced theming documentation and starter pages
