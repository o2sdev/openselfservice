We're excited to announce Release 1.2.0 of Open Self Service, featuring a major architectural improvement in how we handle blocks. This release focuses on making the platform more modular, maintainable, and developer-friendly. Let's explore what's new!

## New features

### Modular Block Architecture

We've completely reworked our approach to blocks by separating all block-related code from the `api-harmonization` and `frontend` apps into independent packages. This architectural change brings several significant benefits:

- **Independent versioning**: Each block can now be versioned separately, allowing for more granular updates
- **Simplified maintenance**: Blocks can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Easier integration**: Adding blocks to your projects is now as simple as installing an NPM package
- **Better developer experience**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable

Each block is now a standalone NPM package with three main components:

1. **API Harmonization Module**: Handles data aggregation and normalization
2. **Frontend Components**: React-based implementations for UI rendering
3. **SDK Methods**: Simplified access to the block's API

With our new block architecture, integrating blocks into your application is more straightforward than ever:

```shell
npm install @o2s/blocks.block-name --workspace=@o2s/api-harmonization --workspace=@o2s/frontend
```

Once installed, blocks can be easily imported and used in both the API Harmonization server and Frontend app with minimal configuration.

Need to customize a block beyond its basic configuration? Our new architecture makes it easy to "eject" a block and take full ownership of its source code:

```shell
npm run eject-block
```

This gives you complete control over the block's implementation while still maintaining compatibility with the rest of your application.
