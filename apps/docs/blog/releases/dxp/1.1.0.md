In this small release, we're bringing significant updates to help you get the most out of DXP Starter Kit with a new Knowledge Base area.

## New features

### Knowledge base

Knowledge Base functionality plays a critical role in delivering useful information to users of a variety of different portals. This functionality has already been implemented earlier in Open Self Service and now has been migrated to the DXP Starter Kit as well!

Weâ€™ve introduced support for new areas in the app related to knowledge base functionality. This includes:

- Pages with **article-like content** (with author, publish date, and rich text content),
- Blocks that display **categories and article lists**,
- Ability to configure pages that act as hubs for such content, like help or support pages.
- **Search component** that can support integrations with search engines like Algolia,
- Full **Strapi integration** for managing knowledge base within the CMS.
