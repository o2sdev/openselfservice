We're excited to announce an initial release of our new **Digital Experience Platform Frontend Starter Kit** built on top of O2S! Kick-start your modern, composable digital platform with our Next.js based starter and built-in CMS integration.

## What is **DXP Starter Kit**?

The Digital Experience Starter Kit is a Frontend starter based on our composable framework design within the Open Self Service. It’s a solid foundation for building much larger solutions and is easy to extend and customize, from simple portals to full-scale digital platforms.

It aims to fill the gap for good open-source solutions for building **complex frontends in a composable architecture**. Too often developers are forced to start from scratch - with a raw framework like React or Svelte, and manually integrate it with a CMS or other APIs. We realized that many aspects of composable platforms could be handled in a generic, reusable way at the frontend level — areas like **API integration, UI composition or content management**.

Such a generic framework can be used in many different scenarios, and although our main focus remains on customer support and self-service, the same foundation works across many use cases. From simple marketing portals to a full-fledged portal with a self-service area with an extensive knowledge base or even with an e-commerce integration, it all can be achieved using the DXP Starter Kit.

So the framework and this starter reflects everything we’ve learned during projects, and we’ve packaged our best practices into an open-source framework that we share with the world today.

## Architecture

The DXP Starter Kit relies on exactly the same architecture that is already [utilized in the Open Self Service](../../../docs/overview/architecture.md), with:

- a decoupled Frontend app,
- an intermediate Harmonization server for data aggregation, orchestration and normalization,
- and a UI component library.

This new starter also is built on top of the [recently released new approach to blocks](../o2s/1.2.0.md) so you can already start with a more modular way of working.

## Features

The DXP Frontend Starter is designed for building knowledge bases, marketing portals, and Digital Experience Platforms (DXP) of any size. It provides a foundation for content-rich applications that can evolve into comprehensive digital experience solutions. Its features can be extended with Blocks or integrations O2S provides or your own.

To get a quick overview about what kind of blocks DXP Starter supports, you can now view our newly released [**Storybook**](http://storybook-dxp.openselfservice.com) and also a [**demo app**](https://demo-dxp.openselfservice.com/) that showcases what can be built using our components.

## Get started now!

To get started, you can use our NPM script to create a new project:

```shell
npx create-dxp-app@latest my-dxp-portal
```

which, just like in O2S, will create a pre-configured template with all the necessary components, integrations, and best practices to accelerate your development.
