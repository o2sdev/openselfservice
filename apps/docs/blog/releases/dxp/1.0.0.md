We're excited to announce an initial release of our new **Digital Experience Platform Frontend Starter Kit** built on top of O2S! Kick-start your modern, composable digital platform with our Next.js based starter and built-in CMS integration.

## What is **DXP Starter Kit**?

The Digital Experience Starter is a frontend starter based on our composable framework architecture, **developed within the Open Self Service project**. It provides a solid foundation for building large-scale solutions, and it is easy to extend and customize, solutions from simple portals to full-fledged digital platforms.

What makes this kit unique is its flexibility. It allows teams to start quickly with a clean, well-structured frontend and evolve over time, adapting the architecture to meet growing business needs and integrating with additional services as needed.

Although it can be used in many contexts, the Starter Kit is particularly well-suited for solutions that involve customer interaction and service enablement. Thanks to its modular, headless, and API-first architecture, it’s **easy to evolve the solution toward rich, customer-facing experiences** - without rebuilding from scratch.

In fact, our long-term development focus is on use cases around customer support and self-service.
That’s where the flexibility and composability of the Starter can deliver the most value — enabling fast, scalable, and future-proof digital platforms.

The framework and this starter reflect everything we’ve learned during real projects. We’ve packaged our best practices into an open-source solution that we’re proud to share with the world today.

## Architecture

The DXP Starter Kit relies on exactly the same architecture that is already [**utilized in the Open Self Service**](../../../docs/overview/architecture), with:

- a decoupled Frontend app,
- an intermediate Harmonization server for data aggregation, orchestration and normalization,
- and a UI component library.

This new starter also is built on top of the [**recently released new approach to blocks**](../o2s/1.2.0.md) so you can already start with a more modular way of working.

## Features

The DXP Frontend Starter is designed for building knowledge bases, marketing portals, and Digital Experience Platforms (DXP) of any size. It provides a foundation for content-rich applications that can evolve into comprehensive digital experience solutions. Its features can be extended with Blocks or integrations O2S provides or your own.

To get a quick overview about what kind of blocks DXP Starter supports, you can now view our newly released [**Storybook**](http://storybook-dxp.openselfservice.com) and also a [**demo app**](https://demo-dxp.openselfservice.com/) that showcases what can be built using our components.

## Get started now!

To get started, you can use our NPM script to create a new project:

```shell
npx create-dxp-app@latest my-dxp-portal
```

which, just like in O2S, will create a pre-configured template with all the necessary components, integrations, and best practices to accelerate your development and is ready for your own customizations.
