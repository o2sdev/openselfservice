# DXP Blocks

DXP Starter Kit offers a set of blocks that are useful in creating landing or product pages without being locked into any pre-defined industry. This means that whether you want to compose a banking-related website or create a homepage for an energy management service, this is a tool for you!

Currently, offered blocks aim to integrate only with a CMS and focus on presenting content. They will be expanded in the future to also include other integrations if they are needed - stay tuned for updates!

Blocks included in DXP Starter Kit include content-heavy components like:

- hero banners,
- CTA sections,
- pricing and offers sections,
- FAQs, lists and more.

For a full list of available blocks, together with their configuration, variants and usage examples, see [our Storybook](https://dxp-starter-kit-storybook.vercel.app).

## Content types

Each block has its own CMS content type defined so that composing pages using blocks is quite straightforward. To use them in your own CMS, take a look into our CMS integrations, where we have prepared ready-to-use exports:
