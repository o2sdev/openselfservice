# O2S Blocks

Blocks included in Open Self Service include both components that only connect with a CMS:

- articles-like sections,
- article categories,
- quick links,
- content search,
- FAQs and more,

and more complex ones that integrate several different data sources, like:

- user invoices, orders and notifications,
- payment history and summary,
- tickets and ticket submissions.

For a full list of available blocks, together with their configuration, variants and usage examples, see [our Storybook](https://openselfservice-storybook.vercel.app).

## Content types

Each block has its own CMS content type defined so that composing pages using blocks is quite straightforward. To use them in your own CMS, take a look into our CMS integrations, where we have prepared ready-to-use exports:
