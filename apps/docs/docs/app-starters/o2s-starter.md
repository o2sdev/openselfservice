# O2S Customer Portal starter

The O2S Customer Portal starter is our default template for building customer self-service applications. It provides a complete foundation with pre-configured UI blocks, integrations, and best practices for customer-facing portals.

```

This command will:
- Download the latest O2S Customer Portal starter
- Install all dependencies
- Set up the project structure with mocked integrations
- Initialize a local SQLite database for authentication

## What's included

- **Frontend app**: Next.js application with pre-configured UI blocks
- **API Harmonization server**: NestJS server for API integration
- **Mocked integrations**: Ready-to-use mocked data for development
- **Authentication**: Local SQLite-based authentication system
- **UI Library**: Pre-built components and design system

## Documentation

All UI blocks and components are documented in our Storybook:
