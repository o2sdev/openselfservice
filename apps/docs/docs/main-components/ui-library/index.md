# UI Library

The UI Library provides a reusable, component-based UI layer designed to ensure UI consistency across applications.
It offers pre-built UI components and configuration utilities, all defined within an internal package located at `./packages/ui`.

## What’s inside?
- **[Essentials](./essentials.md)** – Learn how the UI Library is structured, how to install new components, and how to use or extend them.
- **[Theming](./theming.md)** – Understand how theming works with **shadcn/ui** and how to configure global styles and colors for your application.


:::info
We plan to add **Storybook documentation** for UI components to improve reusability and discoverability of the design system's components.
