# UI Library

The UI Library provides a reusable, component-based UI layer designed to ensure UI consistency across applications.
It offers pre-built UI components and configuration utilities, all defined within an internal package located at `./packages/ui`.

## What's inside?

- **[Essentials](./essentials.md)** – Learn how the UI Library is structured, how to install new components, and how to use or extend them.
- **[Theming](./theming/)** – Understand how theming works with **shadcn/ui**, how to configure themes in CMS, and how to create custom themes for your application.

:::info
We plan to add **Storybook documentation** for UI components to improve reusability and discoverability of the design system's components.
