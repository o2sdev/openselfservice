# Frontend app

The **frontend app** in Open Self Service is a high-performance, modular application built with **Next.js** and designed to serve as the foundation for composable customer portals. It provides a ready-to-use structure, pre-configured features, and customizable pages to accelerate development and deliver seamless customer experiences.

## Pages included in the app

The frontend app comes with pre-built pages to cover common customer portal functionalities. These pages can be extended or modified as needed.

The initial feature set of O2S was designed based on Gartnerâ€™s research on Customer Self-Service Capabilities: https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/topics/self-service-customer-service.
This research outlines the core functionalities required for effective self-service solutions, as illustrated in the image below.
