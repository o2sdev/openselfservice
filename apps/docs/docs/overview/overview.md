# Welcome to Open Self Service

Open Self Service (O2S) is an **open-source framework** built on **composable architecture** principles,
designed to **streamline and accelerate** the development of complex **customer self-service frontend applications**.

O2S provides a **modern, extensible, and customizable frontend starter app**, along with an **integration server**
that makes possible connection of various headless services and APIs commonly used in self-service solutions.
These may include CRMs, ERPs, PIMs, headless commerce platforms, AI assistants, and more, enabling
different business capabilities for the frontend.

By leveraging composable architecture and a modern tech stack, O2S ensures high performance,
frontend-backend decoupling, and architectural flexibility, making it an ideal foundation for scalable and
future-proof self-service solutions.
