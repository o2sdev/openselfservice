# Getting started

To help you get straight to building, we have prepared an export of both the content model and example content from **[Strapi](https://strapi.io/)**. This will significantly simplify the process of setting up your own CMS server by providing you with a predefined structure and sample data to kickstart your project.

With this export, you receive a ready-to-use content model that mirrors O2S's structure, ensuring everything is organized and optimized from the start. From there, you can fully customize both the content model and data to suit your specific needs.

To start, go to our resource repository where you can find the instruction on how to import the content into your own Strapi instance. Depending on which starter you use, this is one of:

- [**Open Self Service** resources](https://github.com/o2sdev/openselfservice-resources/tree/main/packages/cms/strapi/o2s)
- [**DXP Starter Kit** resources](https://github.com/o2sdev/openselfservice-resources/tree/main/packages/cms/strapi/dxp)
