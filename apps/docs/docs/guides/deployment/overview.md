This guide walks you through deploying Open Self Service in production.

- Docker: Build and run the `frontend` and `api-harmonization` services locally or on your own infrastructure.
- Vercel: Deploy the `frontend` app with a monorepo setup. The API should be deployed via Docker or another container platform.

Get started:

- Docker: See [Deploy with Docker](./docker)
- Vercel: See [Deploy on Vercel](./vercel)
