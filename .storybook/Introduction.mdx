# Welcome to O2S UI Library

This Storybook is the living documentation for **Open Self Service (O2S)** — an open-source, composable frontend framework for building customer portals and self-service applications. Here you can browse and test UI components, blocks, and elements in isolation.

## What's in this Storybook

The sidebar is organized into three main sections:

- **Blocks** — Reusable block components from `packages/blocks`. Each block is self-contained (backend + frontend + SDK) and can be used in the customer portal.
- **Components** — Higher-level UI components from the shared `@o2s/ui` package (e.g. cards, filters, data grids).
- **Elements** — Base UI elements (buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc.) from `@o2s/ui`, built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.

Use the sidebar to expand any section and open a component’s docs and stories.

## Running Storybook locally

From the project root:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

The dev server runs at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) by default.

Make sure dependencies are installed (`npm install`) and, if needed, build packages first (`npm run build` or `npm run watch:deps`).

## Public instance

A public Storybook is available and kept in sync with the latest version:

**[https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/](https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/)**

You can explore components there without running the repo locally.

## Features

- **Docs** — Auto-generated documentation from component code and JSDoc.
- **Accessibility** — Use the a11y addon to check components for accessibility issues.
- **Themes** — Switch between light and dark themes to see how components look in both modes.
