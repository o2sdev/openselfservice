# Welcome to O2S UI Library

This Storybook is the living documentation for **Open Self Service (O2S)** — an open-source, composable frontend framework for building customer portals and self-service applications. Here you can browse and test UI components, blocks, and elements in isolation.

## What's in this Storybook

The sidebar is organized into three main sections:

- **Blocks** — Reusable block components from `packages/blocks`. Each block is self-contained (backend + frontend + SDK) and can be used in the customer portal. Think of them as ready‑made business features (for example ticket lists, product views, knowledge-base articles) that already handle data fetching and integration details for you.
- **Components** — Higher-level UI components from the shared `@o2s/ui` package (e.g. cards, filters, data grids). They are used to build layouts, pages, and sections – more generic than blocks, but still opinionated to match the O2S design system and behavior.
- **Elements** — Base UI elements (buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc.) from `@o2s/ui`, built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. These are the building blocks of the library – low-level controls you can compose into your own components and blocks when you need more custom behavior.

Use the sidebar to expand any section and open a component’s docs and stories.

## Public instance

A public Storybook is available and kept in sync with the latest version:

**[https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/](https://storybook-o2s.openselfservice.com/)**

You can explore components there without running the repo locally.

## Testing

Stories are also used as the primary surface for automated tests via Vitest and the `@storybook/addon-vitest` integration. This allows us to run browser-based checks (including accessibility via the a11y addon) against the same stories you see here.
