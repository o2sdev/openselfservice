# Open Self Service (O2S)

**Framework for building composable customer self-service portals.**

**Open Self Service** is an open-source development kit that simplifies the creation of self-service frontend applications by integrating multiple headless APIs into a scalable frontend.
Its flexibility allows for many customizations and lets you build various types of composable frontends.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **API Harmonization Server** – **Integration layer** for data aggregation, orchestration and normalization. Provides vendor lock-in safeness and better maintainability.
- **TypeScript SDK** – Easily interact with the Harmonization Server in the frontend app or any web, mobile, other TS-based apps.
- **Pre-built Integrations** – Ready integrations so that you can set up your solution faster.
- **Extensibility** – Customize UI components, add new pages, add new API integrations, adapt to your needs.
